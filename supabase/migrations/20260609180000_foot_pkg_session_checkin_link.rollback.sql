-- 전략: RPC 2종을 v2(20260609100000) 본문으로 되돌린다(정확매칭 로직 제거 → 순수 근사).
--   ⚠ check_in_id 컬럼/인덱스는 DROP 하지 않음:
--     · 컬럼은 initial_schema(2026-04-19)부터 존재 → 본 티켓 신규생성물 아님(파괴 금지).
--     · idx_package_sessions_check_in 인덱스는 비파괴 additive → 남겨도 무해.
--   FE 가 기록한 check_in_id 값은 통계 RPC 가 무시(근사로만 집계)하므로 데이터 정합성 영향 없음.
